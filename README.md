# UnrealArt - NFT Marketplace of AI generated ART #

This is repo contains the source code of the [UnrealArt website](https://unrealart.io).

The project is a **Single Page Application** made in Vue3. The website is fully animated with the **three.js** library which allowed me to render an immersive art gallery experience.

All the paintings presented in the gallery, were generated by Cuban people using a text-to-image AI (VQGAN-CLIP) at the **Romeria de Mayo** art festival in Holguin, Cuba. Interaction between Creators and AI happened through a Telegram BOT built for the occasion. For more details on the event you can [READ THIS ARTICLE](http://www.acn.cu/cultura/93878-bloguerias-de-mayo-espacio-ideal-para-comunicar-en-redes-fotos).

Users **can mint NFTs** of each piece of art. Of course tokens can be resold in the very same gallery, which acts as a marketplace.

**ETHERS.js** is used to interact with the NFT Smart Contract, which you can check and verify on [BSCSCAN](https://bscscan.com/address/0xdA7807D16A951cf84D124eBb7390A5cfda51A7BB)
